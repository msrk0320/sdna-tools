# Universal SPP Plugin

This folder is the Painter-side part of Universal SPP. It adds a **Universal**
menu to Adobe Substance 3D Painter software and connects that menu to the bundled
converter executable.

The plugin keeps the UI small on purpose:

- **Save as Universal...** packs the current saved `.spp` into a `.uspp`.
- **Open Universal...** opens a `.uspp` or a regular `.spp`. If you choose a
  `.spp`, the plugin automatically packs it into a temporary `.uspp` before it
  plans the conversion for the running Painter version, shows any lossy
  downgrade warning, builds a temporary `.spp`, and opens that copy.
- **Check for Updates...** checks GitHub Releases for a newer plugin build.
- **Plugin Settings...** configures raster fallback capture and update checks.

The plugin does not contain the conversion logic itself. It is a thin Qt/Painter
integration layer over `bin/uspp_tool/uspp_tool.exe`.

## Install

1. Get the `bin/uspp_tool/` converter folder.
   - From a release: download the release build and keep the included
     `universal_spp_plugin/bin/uspp_tool/uspp_tool.exe`.
   - From source: run `build.ps1` from the repository root. It builds the
     converter and copies it into this plugin folder.
2. In Painter, open **Python > Plugins Folder**.
3. Open the `plugins` subfolder.
4. Copy the whole `universal_spp_plugin` folder into that `plugins` folder.
5. Confirm this file exists:

   ```text
   python/plugins/universal_spp_plugin/__init__.py
   ```

6. Confirm the converter exists:

   ```text
   python/plugins/universal_spp_plugin/bin/uspp_tool/uspp_tool.exe
   ```

7. In Painter, choose **Python > Reload Plugins Folder**, or restart Painter.
8. In the **Python** menu, make sure `universal_spp_plugin` is enabled.

After the plugin starts, Painter shows a **Universal** menu in the menu bar. The
plugin also tries to add **Save as Universal (.uspp)...** to Painter's **File**
menu.

Optional: if you use a custom plugin root, set
`SUBSTANCE_PAINTER_PLUGINS_PATH` to a folder that contains Painter's expected
`plugins`, `modules`, and `assets` subfolders.

## Use

### Save a `.uspp`

1. Open a project in Painter.
2. Save it normally as a `.spp` first.
3. Choose **Universal > Save as Universal...**.
4. Pick the output `.uspp` path.

The plugin packs from the `.spp` file on disk. If Painter reports unsaved
changes, the plugin tries to save first, but the hard requirement is still that
the project already has a real file path.

Texture sets left disabled after mesh reassignment are retained in the archive.
They are skipped during raster capture because they have no mesh to render.
Capture failures on texture sets still assigned to the mesh continue to stop
the export and report the missing pixels.

### Open a `.uspp` or `.spp`

1. Choose **Universal > Open Universal...**.
2. Pick a `.uspp` or a regular `.spp`.
3. Review the warning if the target conversion is lossy.
4. Confirm the conversion.

When you pick a regular `.spp`, the plugin first packs it into a temporary
`.uspp`. The plugin then detects the running Painter version, asks the converter
for a plan, and builds a temporary `.spp` in the system temp directory under
`USPPCache`. Before opening that generated copy, the plugin asks where to save
the opened `.spp`, using a source-based name such as
`MyProject - Universal v10.spp`. Painter then opens that real user-chosen path,
so `Ctrl+S`, File > Save, and close prompts do not save back into the temp cache.
The source `.uspp` or `.spp` is not modified.

If the `.uspp` was authored in an older version than the one you are running,
the converter rebuilds the stored project and lets Painter perform its normal
native upgrade when opening it.

### Plugin settings and updates

Choose **Universal > Check for Updates...** to check the public GitHub Releases
page manually. If a newer release is available, the plugin asks before
downloading or installing anything.

The plugin also checks automatically once per day after startup. Automatic
checks only show a prompt; Universal SPP never installs silently. The prompt can
install the update, skip that specific version, remind you later, or turn off
automatic update checks.

Choose **Universal > Plugin Settings...** to configure rasterization:

- Enable or disable raster fallback capture when saving.
- Match the source channel bit depth or force 8-bit/16-bit content captures.
- Use transparent or infinite capture padding.
- Set the raster asset budget stored in each `.uspp`.
- Set how long Painter may evaluate temporary mask channels.
- Keep or discard failed capture diagnostics.

The same dialog also configures updates:

- Enable or disable daily update checks.
- Include or exclude prerelease versions.
- Clear a skipped version.
- See when updates were last checked.
- Open the releases page.

When an update is installed, restart Substance 3D Painter to finish using the
new plugin files. Reloading the plugins folder may work, but a restart is the
cleanest path because Painter can cache plugin code.

## How The Plugin Is Written

The plugin is split so the Painter and Qt code stays away from the converter
process code.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`__init__.py`](__init__.py) | Painter plugin entry point. Creates menus, actions, event hooks, open/save handlers, temp file paths, and cache cleanup. |
| [`lib/runner.py`](lib/runner.py) | Finds and runs `uspp_tool.exe` or `USPP_TOOL`. Streams progress, captures errors, and never uses shell splitting. |
| [`lib/version.py`](lib/version.py) | Detects the running Painter version from the Painter API when available, then falls back to parsing the install path. |
| [`lib/dialogs.py`](lib/dialogs.py) | Qt dialogs for file picking, errors, info messages, and lossy conversion confirmation. |
| [`lib/progress.py`](lib/progress.py) | Progress dialog wrapper around the long-running converter calls. |
| [`lib/updater.py`](lib/updater.py) | Headless updater logic for settings, GitHub release parsing, ZIP validation, checksum checks, installation, and rollback. |

### Open Flow

`on_open()` asks for a `.uspp` or `.spp`, then `_open_path()` does the real
work:

1. Check that the converter is available.
2. If the selected file is a `.spp`, pack it into a temporary `.uspp`.
3. Detect the running Painter version, such as `10`, `12`, or `12.1`.
4. Run:

   ```text
   uspp_tool.exe plan --uspp <file.uspp> --target <running-version>
   ```

5. Stop if no profile path exists.
6. Show the lossy conversion warning if the plan says the downgrade removes
   unsupported data.
7. Run:

   ```text
   uspp_tool.exe build --uspp <file.uspp> --target <running-version> -o <temp.spp>
   ```

8. Ask where to save the opened `.spp` copy.
9. Copy the temporary build to that user-chosen path.
10. Open the saved copy with `substance_painter.project.open()`.
11. Mark the opened copy as needing save so Painter prompts before closing it.

If Painter refuses to open because another dirty project is loaded, the plugin
asks before closing the current project and retrying.

### Save Flow

`on_save()` is intentionally conservative:

1. Check that a project is open.
2. Check that the project already has a saved `.spp` path.
3. Best-effort save the current project if Painter reports unsaved changes.
4. Ask where to write the `.uspp`.
5. Run:

   ```text
   uspp_tool.exe pack <project.spp> -o <output.uspp>
   ```

Because packing reads the `.spp` file directly, an unsaved temporary Painter
scene cannot be exported until it has been saved once.

### Double-Click Support

On Windows, the plugin tries to register a per-user `.uspp` file association in
`HKCU\Software\Classes`. The command is the currently running Painter executable
with the `.uspp` path as its first argument.

When Painter starts from a double-click, the plugin waits until the GUI is ready,
reads `QApplication.arguments()`, finds the `.uspp` path, and opens it through
the same `_open_path()` flow used by the menu.

This is best effort. It does not require admin rights. If registration is
blocked, the menu still works.

## Developer Mode

Set `USPP_TOOL` to run the plugin against a source checkout instead of the
bundled executable:

```powershell
$env:USPP_TOOL = "C:\path\to\universal-spp\spp_downgrader\uspp_tool.py"
```

If `USPP_TOOL` ends in `.py`, `runner.py` launches it with the current Python
interpreter. If it points to an `.exe`, it runs that executable directly.

Useful rebuild command from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1
```

That command builds `spp_downgrader/dist/uspp_tool/` and stages it into
`universal_spp_plugin/bin/uspp_tool/`. Keeping the dependencies unpacked avoids
the repeated extraction cost of a PyInstaller one-file executable.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Check |
| --- | --- |
| **Universal menu does not appear** | Confirm the folder is installed as `python/plugins/universal_spp_plugin/`, then reload plugins and enable it in the **Python** menu. |
| **Converter not found** | Confirm `bin/uspp_tool/uspp_tool.exe` exists inside the plugin folder, or set `USPP_TOOL` during development. Legacy `bin/uspp_tool.exe` releases remain supported. |
| **Project must be saved first** | Save the Painter project as a `.spp`, then run **Save as Universal...** again. |
| **Conversion is reported as unsupported** | The source version cannot reach the target version through the profiles currently shipped in `spp_downgrader/profiles/`. |
| **Loss warning appears** | The target version is older and cannot represent some source data. The warning is generated from the active downgrade profile. |
| **Double-click does not open `.uspp`** | Open from the **Universal** menu. File association is best effort and can be blocked by system policy. |
| **Update check fails** | Check your internet connection and try **Universal > Check for Updates...** again. Automatic check failures are logged silently. |
| **Updated version does not appear** | Restart Substance 3D Painter. Some Painter sessions keep old plugin code cached after files are replaced. |

Supported conversion profile chain:

```text
12.1 -> 12 -> 11 -> 10 -> 9 -> 8.1
```
